# Creating a Google Sheets Data Entry Form with Streamlit

In this project, I demonstrate how to design a data entry form that integrates seamlessly with Google Sheets using Streamlit and the [`streamlit-gsheets-connection`](https://github.com/streamlit/gsheets-connection) library.

## Live Demo
Check out the web app here: https://vendor-data-entry.streamlit.app/

## App Functionality

- **Data Entry Form:** Users can input (& update) data into a form interface designed with Streamlit.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** All data entered into the form is automatically synced with a Google Sheet in real-time using the [`streamlit-gsheets-connection`](https://github.com/streamlit/gsheets-connection) library.
